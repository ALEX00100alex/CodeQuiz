# CodeQuiz
An interactive code quiz with multiple-choice questions and score tracking

## Background 

This is my first attempt at building a multiple choice quiz, incorporating the following elements:
1. HTML
2. CSS 
3. Javascript 

## Code Style

This website is built with HTML and CSS code, with the primary code created using javascript  

## Functionality

When the "Start Quiz" button is clicked, the coding challenge begins:

1. Five multiple-choice questions are asked. When the player starts the quiz, a countdown timer begins to decrement from 75 seconds
2. If the player gets a question wrong, a "Wrong!" message is displayed and the player loses 10 seconds of time 
3. If the player gets a question correct, a "Correct!" message is displayed and they move onto the next question (no time is lost)
3. When they reach the end of the quiz, it displays the player's final score (which is the time taken to complete the quiz, minus any time penalties)
4. The player can then click on the "View Highscores" link, which will take them to a page which displays their score
5. Play can then clear their score and return to the Start page
